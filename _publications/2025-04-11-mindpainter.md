title: "MindPainter: Efficient Brain-Conditioned Painting of Natural Images via Cross-Modal Self-Supervised Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-04-11-mindpainter
excerpt: 'This paper proposes MindPainter, a method for efficient brain-conditioned image editing using brain signals of visual perception as prompts. By employing cross-modal self-supervised learning, it directly reconstructs masked images with pseudo-brain signals generated by the Pseudo Brain Generator, enabling seamless cross-modal integration. The Brain Adapter ensures accurate interpretation of brain signals, while the Multi-Mask Generation Policy enhances generalization for high-quality editing in various scenarios, such as inpainting and outpainting. MindPainter is the first to achieve efficient brain-conditioned image painting, advancing direct brain control in creative AI.'
