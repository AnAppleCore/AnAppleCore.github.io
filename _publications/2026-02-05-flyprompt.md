excerpt: 'General continual learning (GCL) challenges intelligent systems to learn from single-pass, non-stationary data streams without clear task boundaries. We propose FlyPrompt, a brain-inspired framework with a randomly expanded analytic router for instance-level expert activation and a temporal ensemble of output heads, achieving strong gains on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200.'

General continual learning (GCL) challenges intelligent systems to learn from single-pass, non-stationary data streams without clear task boundaries. We propose FlyPrompt, a brain-inspired framework with a randomly expanded analytic router for instance-level expert activation and a temporal ensemble of output heads, achieving strong gains on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200.
