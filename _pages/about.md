> Veritas Invicta!

- 👋Hi there! I'm a PhD student in the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University, working with Professor [Yi Zhong](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1035/2478.htm) and Professor [Kaisheng Ma](https://group.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~maks/leader.html).
- 🤖My research interests are in the field of **brain-inspired AI** and **continual learning**, with a focus on developing machine learning models that can learn and adapt to new tasks and environments and preserve their knowledge and skills over time.
- 🧠I'm also interested in **neuroscience** and **neuroimaging**, hoping to build bridges between biology and computer science.
- 🤝I'm eager to connect with more like-minded individuals and share our ideas! Please feel free to reach out to me via [email](yanhw22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn)!
